- The data is stored as a pickle file (.pkl).

- The complete data with 329 variables is in "CO2_all_variables.pkl" and with 9 variables (329 variables minus the 320 EEG variables) is in "CO2_9_variables.pkl".

The results with all the features is the "CO2_329_variables.ipynb" and the results with only the 9 features (or Non-EEG) is the "CO2_329_variables.ipynb" jupyter notebooks.
